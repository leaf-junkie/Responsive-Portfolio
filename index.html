            <p> 
                Born in Tallahassee, Florida, I moved to North Carolina in 2008 to study biology. I fell in loved with botany 
                and heavily focused on plant sciences during my undergraduate years. As soon as I graduated with my B.S., I 
                delved into graduate school wherein I studied plant-insect interactions.

                I received my M.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Appalachian State University in 2016. 
                My research explored the effects of spatial scale and genotypic diversity of <em>Solidago altissima</em> 
                on the associated insect pollinator community. Simply put, I examined the differences in the phytochemistry 
                among individual plants and how those differences influenced pollinators. 
            </p>                
            <p> 
                I am also an artist/maker and small business owner, having started my sole proprietorship of Calathea Collection 
                in the summer of 2018. Everything that I create is related to plants in some way. I have been painting with acrylic 
                since 2004 and have more recently begun experimenting with watercolor and gouache; I use cement to make small 
                planters (this is quickly becoming my favorite aspect of my business!), and I make macrame plant hangers. You could 
                say that my brand is an ode to the plant kingdom.
